# Light-Detector
Arduino project to detect ambience light with a photo resistor, group the current brightness into three brackets (day, night or twilight) and lights a corresponding LED:

 * Red: Day
 * Green: Twilight
 * Blue: Night

Additional the current brightness level can be transmitted back to PC via a push button press. The button handling is debounced and periodically retransmits the values.
